I'm a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Stony Brook University, working with [Prof. Hyowon Seo](https://seoresearch.github.io/) in the Electrochemical Decarbonization Engineering Lab. My research focuses on developing electricity-driven carbon capture technologies to remove CO₂ from challenging sources such as vehicles, aircraft, and small industrial emitters. I work on optimizing system performance and electrolyte design to improve energy efficiency and scalability. 

In addition, I have extensive experience in membrane separation processes, including designing and fabricating composite membranes with high selectivity and low resistance to enhance overall separation efficiency.

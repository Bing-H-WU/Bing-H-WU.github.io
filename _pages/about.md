I’m a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Stony Brook University, working with <a href="https://seoresearch.github.io/">Prof. Hyowon Seo</a> in the Electrochemical Decarbonization Engineering Lab. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan, where I conducted undergraduate research at the R&D Center for Membrane Technology working with Prof. Kueir-Rarn Lee.

My doctoral research focuses on using electrochemical redox-active materials to operate carbon capture processes. By controlling electron flow into and out of the system, redox mediators undergo reversible reduction and oxidation, regulating proton and hydroxide ion concentrations in the electrolyte. This electrochemically induced pH swing enables carbon dioxide from the gas phase to be converted into dissolved inorganic carbon and stably retained in solution, or reversibly released back to the gas phase.

The system is based on a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and uses aqueous electrolytes as an eco-friendly, non-flammable medium. The limited electrochemical stability of water, however, leads to side reactions such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution during high-rate or long-term operation. My research addresses these challenges by optimizing reaction kinetics, transport processes, and molecular interactions. These strategies are applicable to water electrolyzers, aqueous batteries, and flow batteries.

My bachelor’s research focused on fabricating high-performance membranes for dye/salt separation. By systematically correlating membrane structural parameters, chemical properties, and separation performance, I optimized thin-film composite (TFC) membranes to achieve stable operation with high selectivity, high water flux, and enhanced anti-fouling behavior.

TFC membranes consist of a porous substrate and an ultrathin active layer. The substrate provides mechanical strength and high permeability, while selectivity is governed by a nanometer-scale active layer formed via interfacial polymerization. The thin film was characterized using SEM and AFM to assess morphology and thickness, ATR-FTIR and XPS to analyze chemical composition, and contact angle measurements to evaluate surface wettability. These characteristics were directly correlated with membrane permeability, selectivity, and fouling resistance, enabling precise optimization of separation performance.

In addition, I have extensive experience in membrane separation processes, including designing and fabricating composite membranes with high selectivity and low resistance to enhance overall separation efficiency.

Outside of my research, I enjoy fishing and running. I'm also into basketball and always up for a game!

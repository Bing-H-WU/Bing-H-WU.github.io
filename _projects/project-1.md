title: "High Performance Thin-Film Composite (TFC) membrane"
excerpt: "This project explores how different materials and chemical designs affect the performance of thin-film composite membranes used to filter dyes and salts from wastewater. By tuning the supporting layer and the building blocks of the membrane, we created a design that achieved higher water flow and better separation efficiency. The results help advance more sustainable and cost-effective water purification technologies.<br/><img src='/images/Project1.png'>"

title: "Development of Carbon Capture Prototype"
excerpt: "This projest aims to develop electrochemical carbon capture systems based on molecular redox mediators, focusing on the fundamental electrochemical reactions between the mediator and the surrounding electrolyte environment. My work integrates parameter optimization, pulse-current operation, and electrolyte formulation to enhance reaction kinetics, reduce energy consumption, and improve long-term system stability. By systematically tuning both the operating conditions and the chemical properties of the electrolyte. <br/><img src='/images/ECC.png'>"
